```

**Expected Analysis Result:** 100% GSA compliant with all rules passing

---

## 🏥 Health Check Endpoints

### Basic Health Check
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/healthz
```
**Expected:** `{"ok": true}`

### Comprehensive Health Check
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
```
**Expected:** Status with AI provider information

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Server Won't Start
**Solution:** Check if port 8001 is available
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :8001
```

### Issue: Import Errors
**Solution:** Ensure virtual environment is activated
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Tests Failing
**Solution:** Run individual test components
```bash
python -c "from src.rag_system import RAGSystem; print('RAG OK')"
python -c "from src.document_processor import DocumentProcessor; print('Processor OK')"
```

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### For High-Volume Production
```bash
# Multiple workers
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --workers 4

# With Gunicorn
gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8001
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Production Deployment
- Use HTTPS in production
- Set proper CORS policies
- Configure rate limiting
- Enable request logging
- Use environment variables for secrets

### Example Production Config
```python
# In main.py
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://yourdomain.com"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
